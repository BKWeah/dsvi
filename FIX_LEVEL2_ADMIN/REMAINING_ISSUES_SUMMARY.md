# 🎯 REMAINING ISSUES & SOLUTIONS

## Current Status:
- ✅ `pending_admin_invitations` - NOW WORKING! Invitations are saved
- ✅ `user_profiles` - Working (but has duplicates issue)
- ✅ `admin_profiles` - Working
- ✅ `admin_permissions` - Working
- ❌ `admin_assignments` - EMPTY (school assignments not created)
- ❌ `admin_school_assignments` - EMPTY

## Issues Identified:

### 1. **Duplicate User Profiles**
When creating a Level 2 admin, two `user_profiles` entries are created:
- One with name = temporary password (e.g., "VHVlc2RheSBBZnRlcm5vb24=")
- One with name = "Level 2 Admin"

### 2. **School Assignments Not Created**
Even though invitations have `school_ids` arrays, the assignments aren't being created.

### 3. **Test Script Error**
The test script fails because it uses a random UUID that doesn't exist in auth.users.

## IMMEDIATE FIXES:

### Step 1: Apply the School Assignment Fix
Run `FINAL_SCHOOL_ASSIGNMENT_FIX.sql` which:
- Fixes duplicate user_profiles issue
- Ensures school assignments are created from invitation data
- Adds proper error handling and logging

### Step 2: Check Why Schools Aren't Assigned
Run `CHECK_SCHOOL_ASSIGNMENTS.sql` to see if:
- The school IDs in invitations are valid
- The schools actually exist in the database

### Step 3: Clean Up Duplicates
```sql
-- Remove duplicate user_profiles keeping only the one with auth user ID
DELETE FROM user_profiles up
WHERE up.email IN (
    SELECT email FROM user_profiles 
    GROUP BY email HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
)
AND up.id NOT IN (
    SELECT id FROM auth.users WHERE email = up.email
);
```

## Root Cause Analysis:

The school assignments aren't being created because:

1. **The school IDs in invitations might not exist** - If you're selecting schools that don't exist in the database, the assignments can't be created.

2. **The function might be failing silently** - The current function doesn't check if schools exist before trying to create assignments.

## Quick Test:

1. Check if schools exist:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_schools FROM schools;
```

2. Check if invitation school IDs are valid:
```sql
SELECT 
    pai.email,
    pai.school_ids,
    COUNT(s.id) as valid_schools
FROM pending_admin_invitations pai
LEFT JOIN schools s ON s.id = ANY(pai.school_ids)
GROUP BY pai.id, pai.email, pai.school_ids;
```

## The Complete Solution:

Run `FINAL_SCHOOL_ASSIGNMENT_FIX.sql` and then test by:
1. Creating a new Level 2 admin invitation
2. Make sure to select EXISTING schools
3. Complete the signup
4. Check `admin_assignments` table

**The key issue is likely that the school IDs in the invitations don't match actual schools in the database!**
