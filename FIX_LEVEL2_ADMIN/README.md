# üö® LEVEL 2 ADMIN SIGNUP FIX - SUMMARY

## The Problem
When Level 2 admins sign up, the following records are NOT being created:
- ‚ùå `admin_profiles` 
- ‚ùå `admin_permissions`
- ‚ùå `admin_assignments` / `admin_school_assignments`
- ‚ùì `user_profiles` (might also be affected)

## Root Cause (90% probability)
**Row Level Security (RLS) is blocking the database functions from inserting records.**

Even though the functions exist and are marked as `SECURITY DEFINER`, RLS policies on the tables can still block inserts.

## Quick Fix (Do This First!)

1. **Run this in Supabase SQL Editor:**
```sql
-- Disable RLS on admin tables
ALTER TABLE user_profiles DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE admin_profiles DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE admin_permissions DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE admin_assignments DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE admin_school_assignments DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

2. **Test Level 2 Admin Signup Again**
   - Create a new invitation
   - Complete the signup process
   - Check if records are created

3. **If it works, you found the issue!**

## Proper Fix (After confirming RLS is the issue)

Run `FIX_RLS_ISSUE.sql` to add proper RLS policies that allow the functions to work while maintaining security.

## How to Test

1. **Run Diagnosis:** Execute `TEST_SIGNUP_FLOW.sql` to see exactly where the process fails
2. **Check Existing Issues:** Execute `REAL_DIAGNOSIS.sql` Section 1
3. **Manual Test:** Create a Level 2 admin invitation and watch the browser console for errors

## Files in This Fix Package

1. **ACTION_PLAN.md** - Step-by-step instructions
2. **TEST_SIGNUP_FLOW.sql** - Test the exact signup flow
3. **REAL_DIAGNOSIS.sql** - Comprehensive diagnosis
4. **FIX_RLS_ISSUE.sql** - Fix RLS policies
5. **COMPLETE_FIX.sql** - Create any missing functions
6. **02_CREATE_MISSING_TABLES.sql** - Create tables if missing

## Still Not Working?

If disabling RLS doesn't fix it, the issue might be:
1. Missing tables ‚Üí Run `02_CREATE_MISSING_TABLES.sql`
2. Function errors ‚Üí Check function results in `TEST_SIGNUP_FLOW.sql`
3. Frontend issue ‚Üí Check browser console for JavaScript errors

**The key is to run `TEST_SIGNUP_FLOW.sql` first - it will tell you exactly what's failing!**
