# üö® URGENT: Complete Level 2 Admin Fix

## Current Status:
- ‚úÖ user_profiles - WORKING
- ‚úÖ admin_profiles - WORKING  
- ‚úÖ admin_permissions - WORKING
- ‚ùå admin_assignments - NOT WORKING
- ‚ùå admin_school_assignments - NOT WORKING
- ‚ùå pending_admin_invitations - NOT BEING POPULATED

## The Main Issues:

1. **Invitations not saved to `pending_admin_invitations`** - This is why Level 2 admins don't get proper name, permissions, or school assignments
2. **School assignments not created** - Because invitations aren't saved, there's no school data to use

## IMMEDIATE FIX - Run This SQL Now:

```sql
-- 1. Disable RLS on pending_admin_invitations
ALTER TABLE pending_admin_invitations DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- 2. Grant permissions to authenticated users
GRANT ALL ON pending_admin_invitations TO authenticated;
GRANT USAGE ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA public TO authenticated;

-- 3. Test if it works now
```

## Complete Solution:

### Step 1: Debug Why Invitations Aren't Saving
Run `DEBUG_INVITATION_SAVE.sql` to find the exact problem

### Step 2: Apply The Complete Fix
Run `COMPLETE_INVITATION_AND_ASSIGNMENT_FIX.sql` which:
1. Fixes the `create_admin_invitation` function
2. Updates `process_level2_admin_signup` to use invitation data
3. Creates school assignments from the invitation

### Step 3: Verify
Run `QUICK_VERIFICATION.sql` to ensure everything works

## Alternative Quick Fix:

If the database function still doesn't save invitations, you can modify the frontend to save directly:

```javascript
// In AdminManagementPage.tsx, after calling create_admin_invitation
// Add this fallback:
if (invitationResult?.success) {
  // If invitation wasn't saved to DB, save it directly
  const { error: insertError } = await supabase
    .from('pending_admin_invitations')
    .insert({
      email: newAdminEmail,
      name: newAdminName,
      invite_token: invitationResult.invite_token,
      email_hash: invitationResult.email_hash,
      temp_password: invitationResult.temp_password,
      permissions: selectedPermissions,
      school_ids: selectedSchools,
      created_by: user?.id,
      expires_at: new Date(Date.now() + 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000).toISOString(),
      admin_level: 2
    });
    
  if (insertError) {
    console.error('Failed to save invitation:', insertError);
  }
}
```

## Testing Steps:

1. Create a Level 1 admin invitation with schools selected
2. Run this SQL to check if it was saved:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM pending_admin_invitations ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1;
   ```
3. If no record, the invitation saving is broken
4. Apply the fixes above
5. Test again

## Key Points:

- The `pending_admin_invitations` table stores all the details needed for Level 2 admin creation
- Without this data, the signup process creates a basic admin without proper permissions or schools
- RLS is likely blocking the inserts even with SECURITY DEFINER functions

**Run the SQL fixes first, then test. If still not working, add the frontend fallback code.**
