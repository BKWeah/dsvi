# Admin Levels System Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds a two-level admin system to the DSVI CMS platform:

- **Level 1 (Super Admins)**: Full system access, can manage Level 2 admins
- **Level 2 (Assigned Staff)**: Limited access based on granted permissions and school assignments

## Implementation Details

### Database Changes
- **Migration**: `20250604000000_add_admin_levels_system.sql`
- **New Tables**:
  - `admin_profiles`: Stores admin level information
  - `admin_permissions`: Stores specific permissions for Level 2 admins
  - `admin_assignments`: Tracks school assignments for Level 2 admins
- **New Functions**:
  - `get_admin_level()`: Returns admin level for a user
  - `has_admin_permission()`: Checks specific permissions
  - `get_assigned_schools()`: Returns assigned schools for Level 2 admins
  - `create_admin_profile()`: Creates admin profiles
  - `grant_admin_permission()`: Grants permissions
  - `assign_school_to_admin()`: Assigns schools to admins

### Permission System
- **Level 2 Admin Permissions**:
  - Content Management (pages, media, CMS access)
  - Communication (messaging, templates)
  - Maintenance (school updates, status changes)
  - Monitoring (subscription viewing, activity logs)
  - Support (onboarding, training)

- **Level 1 Only (Restricted Permissions)**:
  - School admin management
  - Billing and subscriptions
  - System settings
  - Admin creation and management
  - Website deployment

### Frontend Updates
1. **New Components**:
   - `AdminProtectedRoute`: Enhanced route protection
   - `AdminManagementPage`: Interface for managing Level 2 admins
   - `useAdmin` hook: Admin state and permission checking

2. **Updated Components**:
   - `AuthContext`: Added admin level tracking
   - `UpdatedResponsiveDSVIAdminLayout`: Shows admin level, conditional navigation
   - `SchoolsPage`: Respects school assignments for Level 2 admins
   - Type definitions in `supabase/types.ts`

3. **Enhanced Routes**:
   - Permission-based route protection
   - Admin management route for Level 1 admins only
   - Backward compatibility maintained

## Backward Compatibility
- Existing DSVI admins are automatically upgraded to Level 1 on login
- All existing functionality preserved for Level 1 admins
- Original `ProtectedRoute` component still works

## Testing Checklist

### Database Testing
- [ ] Run migration successfully
- [ ] Test admin profile creation
- [ ] Test permission granting
- [ ] Test school assignment

### Authentication Testing
- [ ] Existing DSVI admin can log in
- [ ] Admin level is correctly set to 1 for existing users
- [ ] New Level 2 admin creation works
- [ ] Permission checking functions work

### UI Testing
- [ ] Navigation shows correct items based on admin level
- [ ] Admin management page accessible to Level 1 only
- [ ] Level 2 admins see only assigned schools
- [ ] Permission-based feature access works

### Integration Testing
- [ ] School requests page (Level 1 only)
- [ ] Subscription management (Level 1 only)
- [ ] Content management (both levels with permissions)
- [ ] Messaging system (with permissions)

## Security Considerations
- All permission checks done server-side via RPC functions
- Level 2 admins cannot escalate privileges
- School assignments strictly enforced
- Sensitive operations require Level 1 admin access

## Known Limitations
1. Email display in admin list shows placeholder (auth.users not directly accessible from client)
2. Real-time permission updates require page refresh
3. Advanced role-based field-level permissions not implemented

## Future Enhancements
1. Real-time permission updates
2. Granular field-level permissions
3. Audit logging for admin actions
4. Bulk permission management
5. Permission templates/presets
