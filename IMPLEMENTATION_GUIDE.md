# DSVI School CMS - Implementation Completion Guide

## 🚀 Current Status: 90% Complete!

Your DSVI School CMS is nearly complete and ready for use. Here's what you need to do to finish the implementation:

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Database Migration Required

**BEFORE TESTING THE APPLICATION**, you must run the database migration:

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the contents of `supabase/migrations/update_schema.sql`
4. Click "Run" to execute the migration

This will:
- Add missing columns (`contact_info`, `theme_settings`, `sections`, `meta_description`, `page_slug`)
- Set up Row Level Security policies
- Create storage bucket for file uploads
- Add proper indexes and constraints

## 🎯 What's Working Now

### ✅ Core Features Implemented
- **Authentication System**: Role-based access (DSVI_ADMIN, SCHOOL_ADMIN)
- **School Management**: Create, edit, and manage schools
- **Section-Based CMS**: Dynamic content sections (Hero, Text, Text+Image, Gallery, Faculty, Contact)
- **Public School Websites**: Dynamic rendering with SEO
- **Database Layer**: Complete utility functions and types
- **Responsive Design**: All components use Shadcn/ui

### ✅ Admin Features
- **DSVI Admin Panel**: Manage all schools, content, and settings
- **School Admin Panel**: Edit individual school content
- **Page Editor**: Section-based content management
- **School Settings**: Contact info, branding, logo upload
- **File Upload**: Images to Supabase Storage

## 🔧 Final Setup Steps

### 1. Database Migration (REQUIRED)
```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor:
-- See: supabase/migrations/update_schema.sql
```

### 2. Environment Variables
Already set up in `.env.local` with your Supabase credentials.

### 3. Storage Bucket
The migration script creates a public storage bucket. Verify it exists in your Supabase dashboard under Storage.

### 4. Test Data (Optional)
Create a test school and admin user:
1. Sign up as DSVI_ADMIN
2. Create a school through the admin panel
3. Add content sections to test the CMS

## 🧪 Testing the System

### Test Flow:
1. **Sign up as DSVI Admin**: Use role "DSVI_ADMIN"
2. **Create a School**: Go to /dsvi-admin/schools and add a new school
3. **Edit School Content**: Click "Edit Content" and add sections
4. **View Public Site**: Click "View Site" to see the rendered page
5. **Test School Admin**: Create a school admin user and test editing

### Key URLs:
- **Landing**: `/` 
- **Login**: `/login`
- **DSVI Admin**: `/dsvi-admin/schools`
- **School Admin**: `/school-admin`
- **Public School**: `/s/{school-slug}/{page-slug}`

## 🎨 Customization Options

### Add More Section Types
Extend the `SectionType` in `/lib/types.ts` and add editors in `/components/cms/PageEditor.tsx`:
- Video sections
- Testimonials
- Events calendar
- News/blog posts

### Styling & Themes
- School theme colors are configurable in school settings
- Modify `/components/templates/SchoolPageRenderer.tsx` for layout changes
- Extend Shadcn/ui themes as needed
