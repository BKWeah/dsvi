# Fix Summary for Level 2 Admin Issues

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. Level 2 Admin Showing as Level 1
**Problem**: After successful signup and login, Level 2 admins were showing as Level 1 due to async profile creation.

**Solution**:
- Modified `AuthContext.tsx` to set admin level immediately after successful profile creation
- Added retry logic with exponential backoff in `fetchAdminLevel` for recently activated admins
- Admin level is now properly set to 2 immediately after the `safe_create_admin_profile` RPC call succeeds

### 2. Schools Page Flickering
**Problem**: Aggressive retry mechanism caused the page to flicker repeatedly when admin level couldn't be determined.

**Solution**:
- Replaced aggressive retry mechanism with a single attempt for recently activated admins
- Added `hasAttemptedRefresh` flag to prevent continuous retries
- Improved loading state handling to avoid flickering
- Only shows error state after refresh attempt fails, not during loading

### 3. Database Functions
**Created**: `fix_level2_admin_issues.sql` migration file with:
- Optimized `safe_create_admin_profile` function for immediate profile creation
- Updated `get_admin_level` function for better performance
- Added index on `admin_profiles` table for faster lookups

## How to Apply the Fixes:

1. **Database Migration**:
   ```sql
   -- Run the migration file in Supabase
   -- This will update the functions and add the index
   ```

2. **Code Changes**:
   - AuthContext.tsx: Enhanced admin level fetching with retry logic
   - SchoolsPage.tsx: Removed aggressive retry mechanism
   - useAdmin.ts: Fixed profile fetching logic

## Testing:

1. **Test Level 2 Admin Signup**:
   - Create a new Level 2 admin invitation
   - Sign up with the invitation token
   - Verify admin level shows as 2 immediately after login

2. **Test Schools Page**:
   - Navigate to Schools page as Level 2 admin
   - Verify no flickering occurs
   - Verify page loads properly with assigned schools

## Additional Notes:

- The fix maintains backward compatibility with existing admins
- Level 1 admins are unaffected by these changes
- The retry logic only applies to recently activated Level 2 admins
