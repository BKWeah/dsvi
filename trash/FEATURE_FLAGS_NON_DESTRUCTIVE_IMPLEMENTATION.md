## 📋 **NEXT STEPS:**

1. **Test your restored app:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # Verify everything works as expected
   ```

2. **Explore feature management (optional):**
   ```bash
   # Visit /deploy when ready
   # Try toggling features
   # Export your configuration
   ```

3. **Use for deployment (when needed):**
   ```bash
   # Configure features for production
   # Deploy with controlled feature set
   # Enable features gradually
   ```

## 🔧 **EMERGENCY PROCEDURES:**

### **If Feature Flags Cause Issues:**
1. **Ignore them** - They don't affect normal operation
2. **Visit `/deploy`** - Reset to defaults  
3. **Use CLI** - `npm run features:reset`

### **If Normal App Has Issues:**
- The restoration should have fixed all original functionality
- If problems persist, they're unrelated to feature flags
- Feature flag system is completely isolated

## 🎯 **SUMMARY:**

**Your DSVI webapp is now:**
- ✅ **Fully functional** with all original features
- ✅ **Enhanced** with optional feature flag capabilities  
- ✅ **Non-destructive** - feature flags don't interfere with normal use
