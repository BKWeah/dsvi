## DSVI Admin Management Issue Fix Summary

### Issues Found and Fixed:

#### 1. **Primary Issue: Undefined Variables in AdminManagementPage.tsx**
**Problem:** The `createLevel2Admin` function was trying to use `emailHash`, `inviteToken`, and `tempPassword` variables that were not properly extracted from the `invitationResult` object.

**Error:** 
```
ReferenceError: emailHash is not defined at createLevel2Admin (AdminManagementPage.tsx:216:62)
```

**Fix Applied:**
- Modified the variable extraction to properly get values from `invitationResult`
- Added error handling for missing values
- Updated clipboard functionality to use the correct variable

#### 2. **Missing Database Function**
**Problem:** The `create_admin_invitation` database function was not properly deployed or was missing the `email_hash` field in its return value.

**Solution:** 
- Created migration file: `20250609000003_add_admin_invitation_system.sql`
- Created quick fix script: `QUICK_FIX_ADMIN_INVITATION_SIMPLE.sql`

### Files Modified:

1. **AdminManagementPage.tsx**
   - Fixed variable extraction from `invitationResult`
   - Added proper error handling for email hash decoding
   - Fixed clipboard copy functionality

2. **Database Migration Files Created:**
   - `20250609000003_add_admin_invitation_system.sql` (Complete migration)
   - `QUICK_FIX_ADMIN_INVITATION_SIMPLE.sql` (Quick fix for immediate use)

### Next Steps Required:

1. **Apply Database Fix:**
   - Go to your Supabase Dashboard
   - Navigate to SQL Editor
   - Run the contents of `QUICK_FIX_ADMIN_INVITATION_SIMPLE.sql`

2. **Test the Fix:**
   - Start your development server
   - Navigate to Admin Management page
   - Try creating a Level 2 admin invitation
   - The error should now be resolved

### Status:
✅ Frontend code fixed and building successfully
✅ Database function script ready for deployment
⏳ Manual database deployment required (see Next Steps)

### Root Cause:
The frontend code was expecting specific fields (`email_hash`, `invite_token`, `temp_password`) from the database function response, but the function either didn't exist or wasn't returning these fields in the expected structure.
