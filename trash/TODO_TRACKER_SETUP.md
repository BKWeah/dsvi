# DSVI TODO Tracker - Supabase Integration

## ✅ Fixed Issues

I've removed the unnecessary SQLite backend and properly integrated with your existing Supabase setup:

- ❌ Removed: `todo-api/` folder (SQLite backend)
- ✅ Added: Supabase migration for TODO tracking 
- ✅ Updated: TodoTrackerPage to use Supabase
- ✅ Created: Client approval interface
- ✅ Added: Proper TypeScript types

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### 1. Run the Supabase Migration

```bash
# Navigate to your project root
cd C:\Users\USER\Desktop\Code\Desktop Apps\0_Upwork\dsvi

# Run the new migration
supabase db push
```

This will create:
- `project_tasks` table for TODO tracking
- `project_task_audit` table for change history
- Proper RLS policies for global access
- Initial 130-hour MVP task data
