# Level 2 Admin Signup - DUPLICATE PROCESSING FIX

## 🎯 **ROOT CAUSE: DUPLICATE PROCESSING**

Both AuthContext and Level2AdminSignupPage were trying to create the same admin record:

1. **AuthContext**: ✅ Creates Level 2 admin → Marks invitation as "used"
2. **Level2AdminSignupPage**: ❌ Tries to use same invitation → "Invitation not found!"

## **🔧 FIX APPLIED:**

Level2AdminSignupPage now checks if admin record already exists:
- **If exists**: "Already created!" → Show success → Redirect  
- **If doesn't exist**: Create it using direct function

## **✅ EXPECTED RESULT:**

Console will show:
```
🔄 Checking if Level 2 admin record already exists...
✅ Level 2 admin record already exists - created by AuthContext!
```

Then: Success message → Redirect to login

**No more "Invitation not found" errors! 🎉**
