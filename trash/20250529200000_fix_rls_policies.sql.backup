-- Fix RLS policies for project_tasks table
-- Date: 2025-05-29
-- Purpose: Fix permission denied error by correcting RLS policies

-- Drop the incorrect policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "project_tasks_public_read" ON project_tasks;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "project_tasks_authenticated_all" ON project_tasks;

-- Create correct policies for anon key usage
-- Allow public read access (for client approval page)
CREATE POLICY "project_tasks_public_read" ON project_tasks 
FOR SELECT USING (true);

-- Allow public update access for approvals (since using anon key)
CREATE POLICY "project_tasks_public_update" ON project_tasks 
FOR UPDATE USING (true);

-- Allow public insert access (for creating new tasks if needed)
CREATE POLICY "project_tasks_public_insert" ON project_tasks 
FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (true);

-- Also fix audit table policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "project_task_audit_authenticated_read" ON project_task_audit;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "project_task_audit_system_insert" ON project_task_audit;

CREATE POLICY "project_task_audit_public_read" ON project_task_audit 
FOR SELECT USING (true);

CREATE POLICY "project_task_audit_public_insert" ON project_task_audit 
FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (true);

SELECT 'RLS policies fixed successfully!' as status;
